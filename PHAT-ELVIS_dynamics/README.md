# PHAT-ELVIS Dynamics

___Disclaimer___: *Contents published here were to aid in other scientists' analysis*. This is old work and I generally don't write my code like this anymore. 

Snippets of work done UC Irvine regarding dynamical analysis of satellite galaxies of Milky Way-like systems; I used a suite from [PHAT-Elvis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12413), a suite of Milky Way-size galaxies (dark matter halo + evolving disk potential), to study the dynamics and structure of smaller, orbiting halos. 

Results are not publsihed
