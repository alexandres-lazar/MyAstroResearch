# coreEinasto Profile

Snippets of work done for my one of my first big projects done for my Doctrate at UC Irvine during my first year; I derive a new analytical dark matter profile to model the density structure of simulate FIRE [(Feedback In Realistic Environments)](https://fire.northwestern.edu/) galaxies. 

Preprint of published results are here: [arXiv:2004.10817](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10817)
